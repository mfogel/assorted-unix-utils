# virtualenvwrapper postmkvirtualenv (sourced) to workaround #122
#
# NOTE: as of virtualenvwrapper v3.1 this is no longer needed.
#       #122 has been fixed.
#
# This script deactivates the virtualenv, then re-activates it. This
# allows the activation hooks to see the .project link on first activation
# (if it were set up with the -a flag).
#
# To enable: in your virtualenvwrapper postmkvirtualenv hook, add a line:
#   source <path-to-this-file>

#set -x
